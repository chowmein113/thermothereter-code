# thermothereter-code
This code is built upon already written code which the can be found here: https://robojax.com/learn/arduino/?vid=robojax_MLX90614-DCI_long_range
and all rights go to  Limor Fried/Ladyada for Adafruit Industries.  
This code also uses pre-existing libraries from BLYNK to work with the BLYNK app on mobile phones
The code I made combines both esp's wifi capabiliies and arduino's GP I/O's through serial communication to grab temperature data from IR sensor and push it to the display on mobile phone
